This is a fork of i3wm with several implementations that cannot be done with configuration changes. 

It contains several improvements (for me), including saner and cleaner split container titles and a small layout indicator on window titles showing the parent container layout (a pet-peeve of mine).

*Please note that these changes may (probably) only be appreciated by me and my sensitive window-tiling tendencies.*

i3 is a tiling window manager for X11.
